# The Raiz Syntax
I am really thoughtful about this language's syntax. 
I will try to not make a bad syntax. I'm not sure about what is a bad syntax, 
could be something like Go does to separate private and public functions, 
types and struct fields, etc; or even the use of `::` as access 
operator in Rust or C++; the use of `;` to end statements in 
many languages; the use of `<` and `>` at generic types. Well... About the 
statement end marker, i can't remove it totally because this language will be 
based on expressions, then, i need to have an easy way to separate statements 
of expressions. But i can replace it with another symbol (will be `!`).
